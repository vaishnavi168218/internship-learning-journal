- Add files as per convinence and modify them accordingly

## ✅ Step 4: Commit & Push (Daily Workflow)

After updating notes locally:

```bash

git add .

# commit with a clear message (MUST mention module)
git commit -m "Updated Module-04 Data Sourcing: added web-scraping examples and notes"

# push to your fork
git push origin main
```

## Important:
