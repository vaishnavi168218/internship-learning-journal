# What I Learned from TDS Bootcamp – Session 1
- I understood why Linux is mandatory for Data Science and real-world deployments.
- I learned that most production systems and cloud servers run on Linux, not Windows.
- I realized that knowing only model training is not enough; deployment and APIs are equally important.
- I learned the importance of setting up the environment correctly before starting any project.
- I understood why WSL2 is recommended instead of dual boot or virtual machines.
- I learned that even small mistakes in setup (like spaces in usernames or not updating the system) can cause major issues later.
- I understood how Linux command-line usage helps in automation and reproducibility.
- I learned that TDS focuses on real-world skills rather than just marks or certificates.
- I realized that copying solutions without understanding will fail in interviews and projects.
- I learned that collaboration is allowed, but individual understanding is necessary.
- I understood the importance of starting projects early and reading the full problem statement carefully.
- I learned that APIs act as a bridge between data, models, and applications.
- I realized that deployment-first thinking is required for modern data science roles.
- I learned that using GPT is helpful only when combined with strong fundamentals.
- I understood that building systems is more important than just completing assignments.

## Summary
This session helped me build the right mindset for the TDS course by focusing on Linux, deployment, environment setup, and real-world data science practices.
