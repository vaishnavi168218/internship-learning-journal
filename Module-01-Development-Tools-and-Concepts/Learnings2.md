## My Learnings from Session 2 – WSL & Ubuntu Setup

- I understood why Linux is mandatory for the Tools in Data Science course and how WSL provides a real Linux environment on Windows without using virtual machines or dual booting.

- I learned how to check existing WSL distributions and identify their WSL versions using PowerShell commands.

- I gained hands-on experience in safely shutting down all WSL instances before making system-level changes.

- I learned how to remove unused or corrupted Linux distributions and keep only the required Ubuntu version.

- I understood the importance of setting WSL 2 as the default version for better performance and compatibility with data science and deployment tools.

- I successfully launched Ubuntu and created a Linux user account, understanding the role of usernames and passwords in a Linux environment.

- I learned how to update and upgrade Linux packages immediately after installation to avoid common dependency and compatibility issues.

- I understood the Linux file system structure, especially the difference between the Linux home directory and mounted Windows drives.

- I learned how Windows drives are accessed inside Linux using the `/mnt` directory, enabling smooth file sharing between Windows and Ubuntu.

- I installed Git inside Ubuntu and configured global user details required for version control and GitHub usage.

- I understood how WSL with Ubuntu creates a production-like development environment that will be used throughout the TDS course for assignments, projects, and deployment tasks.
