## Key Learnings – Session 4 (Environment Setup & CLI Tools)

- Understood why a clean and reproducible development environment is critical for data science and AI projects.
- Learned how package managers like **Homebrew** simplify installing and maintaining development tools on macOS/Linux.
- Gained hands-on experience using **pyenv** to manage multiple Python versions and avoid conflicts with system Python.
- Learned to set **project-specific Python versions** using `pyenv local`, ensuring consistency across machines and collaborators.
- Understood the importance of isolating environments to prevent dependency and version clashes.
- Learned to use **UV** as a fast and modern alternative to `pip` and `venv` for managing Python projects and dependencies.
- Experienced how UV speeds up dependency resolution and keeps project configuration clean via `pyproject.toml`.
- Learned to initialize and manage Git repositories directly from the terminal.
- Used **GitHub CLI** to create and push repositories without leaving the command line, improving workflow efficiency.
- Understood how command-line tools enable automation-friendly and reproducible workflows.
- Learned how **LLM CLI tools** can be integrated directly into the terminal for AI-assisted development.
- Configured and used the **Gemini model** via CLI, enabling quick queries without web interfaces.
- Realized that combining CLI tools with version control leads to scalable, production-ready development practices.
- Developed confidence in setting up a full development environment from scratch without relying on GUI-heavy tools.
