## My Learnings – Session 3 (WSL, Linux CLI & LLM Tools)

- I understood how WSL2 works internally using virtualization and how it allows Linux to run efficiently on Windows systems.

- I learned how the computer boot process connects to operating systems and how WSL integrates with Windows using Hyper-V technology.

- I gained practical experience navigating the Linux file system using command-line tools such as `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and `touch`.

- I understood the difference between absolute and relative paths and learned how to use special directory shortcuts such as `~`, `.`, and `..`.

- I learned how Linux and Windows file systems differ, including case sensitivity, directory structures, and file access methods.

- I understood how Windows drives are mounted inside Linux using the `/mnt` directory, enabling cross-platform file access.

- I learned how to integrate Visual Studio Code with WSL to create a professional Linux-based development environment.

- I gained knowledge about the importance of command-line tools for automation, scripting, server management, and reproducible data science workflows.

- I learned how to install and use the UV tool as a modern and faster alternative to traditional Python package managers.

- I successfully installed and configured the LLM CLI tool to interact with large language models directly from the terminal.

- I learned how to securely configure API keys for Gemini and OpenAI-based services.

- I gained hands-on experience querying GPT and Gemini models using terminal commands, improving productivity and workflow efficiency.

- I understood how AI tools can be integrated into command-line workflows for coding assistance, automation, and faster problem-solving.
