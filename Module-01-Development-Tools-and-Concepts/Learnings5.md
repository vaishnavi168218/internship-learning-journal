## Key Learnings – Git & GitHub Setup (TDS Session)

- I understood the importance of proper Git and GitHub setup for successfully completing TDS assignments and projects.

- I learned that watching the live sessions helps avoid common configuration and workflow mistakes that can block assignment submissions.

- I gained clarity on the role of Git as a version control system and how it helps track changes, manage history, and collaborate efficiently.

- I learned how GitHub acts as a remote platform for storing repositories and evaluating coursework.

- I understood why configuring Git user identity (name and email) is mandatory for meaningful and traceable commits.

- I learned the difference between HTTPS and SSH authentication and why SSH is the recommended and secure method for GitHub access.

- I gained knowledge about SSH keys, including the concept of public and private keys and their role in secure authentication.

- I understood the complete Git workflow from creating a repository to pushing local changes to GitHub.

- I learned how to identify and troubleshoot common Git errors instead of relying on trial-and-error.

- I gained insight into why Linux environments are preferred for development and how WSL provides better compatibility on Windows systems.

- I learned the importance of consistent development environments to avoid unexpected errors during assignments.

- I was introduced to modern Python environment management concepts to maintain project isolation.

- I learned about GitHub Copilot as a productivity tool and understood the importance of using it responsibly.

- I realized that understanding the code is more important than generating it, especially for learning and interview readiness.
